So here oops comes in handy to arrange them as well as acess them by their respetive class\n",

        "   - objects = when class are defined having any mathods or any property which may contain logics usuelly . So in order to acess and exicute those method outside of class objects are used without objects we can not define class . instance - when we define any class along with objects that time objects get assosiated with class and have access of entire class method . to be clear objects are very essential part of classes in oops . In addition obejects even can modify the class methods attriutes .\n",

Mean not showing unncessery things and revealing only neccessry things . Absration is performed using (import abc ) it is nothing just a collection of function . abstraction classes can not be accessed in objects therofor abstract classes are passed in subclases these subclass can be accessed in objects , however subclass also only  contain those all abstract method . mean abstraction is a way to hide things from user\n",

        "  2. private = private are defined by using double undersocre . these varibles neither can be accessed nor can be defined outside of the class . but these are accessed only inside the class by defining other method which containes these private data . if we have class having private data and which is being inherted in any subclass /derived class in such situation despite inheritation these private varriables can not be accessed . Not visible to user while calsses are being accessed by objects .\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. protected = these data are defined by single undersocre . the main speciality which makes it diffrent is protected not only can access and modify data inside the class but outside the class also . which makes it more usefull then private . these are by diffault not visible to user.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - private = here data is not visible outside of the class when deifned in private format . the very method which is written to access private method can be wirtten inside the class only not outside . mean private varible can not accessed to another class , not even when class is being inherited into subclass . this is the another way to reach incapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "   - protected = it is diffrent from above both data mean here not only we can access and modify data inside class but to its subclass also . it is witten by single underscore . however it is also not visible to by objects but by definening into method can be accessed .\n",

        "   - constructer = contructer allows us to modify class and methods wihtout modifying their original code , makes our code more appropirate and saves time . working = first define any function normally or inside class which offen contain the pattern or design which we want , and that fuction takes function as an argument  . afterwards that perticuller on whom we want design to be applied , is assosiated with above mentioned method . so by doing this any pre deined method having any design can be applied on n number of method . it saves times and even doesn not touch the original code of individual method .\n",

In class method we have to pass first permeter as a CLS instead SELF . Another importent thing is right above the method (@classmathod) text is written which is must to turn a normal method into class fuction . even we may say it is an replacement of init constructer method . In addition class mehtod can access and modify the state of class and instance . Class method directly refers to the class .\n",

IN such situations when we define any objects accessing the child  class and try to figure the commen method then method which is stored inside the child /derived class will certainly be exicuted dispite parsent class have same mathod . So in parent and in child class child class is always way way powerfull then parent .  \n",

Method which is wirtten inside abstract class can not be accessed directly here we have to inhrent it into subclass afterwards we will be able to access it by objects . A subclass is always passed for abstract class . In abstract class method are only passed which does not get imploment , therfor here sublcass is responsible to get those method implimented . IN inherited abstract class any method is not present then while getting accessed it must not thorw error , despite unavilable .\n",
